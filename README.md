## My process
In the interest of full transparency, I'll use this section to record my process as honestly as possible. 

Step 1) Figure out how git works.

This is nearly my first time using git for version control. I still have a lot of questions.

What is an origin and master?
What is a remote and why do I have to add one?
I created a repository and it doesn't seem like anything changed on my local end, is that what's supposed to happen?

I created a 'working' branch, because it seemed like the thing to do. Leave the master branch pristine until such time as I am confident with what I've created. 

I still have a lot of github questions between here and mastery and some of my github questions involve the Version Control tab in Visual Studio Code. 

  Step 2)

  Look at the design. Estimate what the major components of the build will be. Estimate what the major obstacles would be. Set a time estimate.

  Major Components

  One big card with three divs
  -backgroundDiv
  -InfoDiv
  -StatsDiv

Step 3) Build it out


  Somehow, we're gonna absolutely position the circular picture and give it a white border I think.

  Major Obstacles
    The bubble background seems complex. I don't really know how to do that. Making the picture circular 

  Time Estimate 
  
  90 minutes? I hope?
### Built with

- VS Code
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

Thing One: What are SVGs and how to use them?

I'd never used SVGs in a project before to create a background. Using SVGs to create the bubble effect on this project was fairly easy. I just absolutely positioned and moved around the bubbles. I understand that SVGs can do a lot more, so, I'm looking forward to seeing that. 


Absolutely positioned elements are very particular. 
Absolutely positioned, right, 50% aligns the right side of an element with halfway across the screen. 

Most of my difficulty in this project, for me, was figuring out how to position the SVGs such that they did not move or change size with the screen.
